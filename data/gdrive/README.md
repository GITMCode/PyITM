The files within this folder are hosted on Google drive

Running the tests requires the google drive folder be placed here, otherwise data will 
be missing

The folder can be found at:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zm0fjwL2bZPdUGRAdEJeaNmtiklNI8RV?usp=sharing


There are two options to get this data:

1. Download the data, unzip the folder, and place the contents here.

2. Use `rclone` to copy the data. This is a little more involved, but can be faster in
the long-run if you are going to be doing development and/or updating the data within
this folder.
