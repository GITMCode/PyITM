# PyITM
Python codes for ionosphere/thermosphere model analysis

## Installation

Optionally activate a Python environment, then:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:GitmCode/PyITM.git
cd PyITM
pip install .
```

For a "development" install, where you are able to change & use the Python code without
needing to reinstall, change the last line to:

``` bash
pip install -e . 
```

This code is still very much in development!
